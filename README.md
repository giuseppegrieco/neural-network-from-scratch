# Neural Network from Scratch

This repository contains an implementation of a neural network from scratch, as well as a cascade correlation architecture and utility functions for experimenting with k-fold cross validation. The neural network can be used with multiple layers and different configurations.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* NumPy

## Dataset

The repository includes a dataset called cup, which was provided by the professor for evaluation and testing purposes.

## Credits

This project was completed for Machine Learning acedemic course in 2019 @UNIPI.
